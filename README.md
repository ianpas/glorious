# Feature

1. Architecture: component based. <br>
   The game scene is a container of game objects, and a game object is a container of components.
   
2. Graphics: D3D11 <br>
   Simple texture and lighting.
   
3. Physics: Bullet <br>
   Simple rigidbody interaction and collision detection.
   
4. Model: FBX format, see [mesh-get](https://github.com/ianpas/mesh-get).

5. Gameplay: Unity style <br> 
   Awake, Start and Update... in "C++ script" <br>
   Sounds funny :)
